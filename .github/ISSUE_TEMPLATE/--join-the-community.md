# Help support Design Systems

We want the design system to be a community orientated open-source product. To encourage developers and designers to engage in the community, we accept contributions from anyone willing to donate their time.

There are several ways you can contribute:

1. Participate in the discussions on the [community forums](https://community.digital.gov.au/c/designsystem)

2. Donate developer time on the [open issues](https://github.com/govau/uikit/issues)

3. Identify any bugs or improvements and create an issue
